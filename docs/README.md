# Document map

[日本語](README.ja.md)

Every document has one role; other documents link to it instead of repeating its content. Every user-facing page comes as an English/Japanese pair (`name.md` / `name.ja.md`); only the agent instructions, the license/notice texts and the overlay manifest (a provenance record whose hashes have one owner) are English-only by design. The changelog is a pair from 1.6.0 on: the English file is canonical, the GitHub Release is made from it, and earlier versions exist in English only. Update both when user-visible instructions change ([Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## Conventions

- Change history lives in the [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md) and Git; documents do not accumulate "what changed" notes.
- A measured number appears once, in its owner document, with image, source and workload conditions. Other pages link to it. The README's headline section is the one permitted copy: `tools/check_publication.py` ties its heading to the newest measured version.
- `tools/check_publication.py` also keeps this map and the architecture page in step with the tree: the README's short-name citation must carry the version in `pyproject.toml`, every `docs/*.md` must be a link target of this map (Japanese pages of the Japanese map), and every module of `glm53_setup/` and `tools/` must be named in [architecture](architecture.md), either by file name or by a pattern such as `benchmark_*.py`.
- Task types are always listed in the order counting / prose / code, and teacher-forced texts in the order Japanese / English / code / mathematics, in every table and sentence that names more than one.
- The release version is owned by `pyproject.toml` and each version is described in the [Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md); `python tools/check_publication.py` requires a plain semantic version there and rejects links to `records/`, plan files or paths outside the repository.
- Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag publishes the GitHub Release: `.github/workflows/release.yml` takes that version's section from the Changelog (`python tools/release_notes.py X.Y.Z`) and refuses a tag that disagrees with `pyproject.toml` or has no section.
- The GitHub repository description and topics restate the README summary with the short name and without any measured number or version, because `tools/check_publication.py` cannot see them; when the summary changes, edit them with `gh repo edit`.
- Related research outside this repository, such as the Euryale draft-proposer project, is described in the README without links, because it is not part of this distribution; other documents mention it only in passing.
