# Architecture

[日本語](architecture.ja.md)

The project is a checkout-local operator toolkit. Source archives contain no weights or remotely managed service. The optional LPA weights are a separate Release asset; [operations](operations.md#artifact-storage-and-paths) owns the package layout and installation paths.

## Where to start reading

Four kinds of code, distinguished by what a test can do with them rather than by any framework:

| | What it holds | Named seams |
|---|---|---|
| **Entry** | The argument interface, and which handler an action reaches | `server.ACTIONS`, `cluster.ACTIONS`, `__main__.COMMANDS` |
| **Assembly** | The order steps run in, and what a failure rolls back | `switch.switch`, `server.act_launch`, `cluster.act_switch` |
| **Decision** | Settings validated, arguments built, reports shaped — pure functions | `server_config.VALIDATORS`, `server_config.SERVE_STEPS`, `validation.*.engine_kwargs`, `runtime.apc_policy`, `runtime.patch_*.patch_text` |
| **Side effect** | docker, HTTP, subprocess, torch, vLLM | `host.run`, `model_http`, the lazy GPU imports inside each runner |

The decision layer is where the numbers live that make one measurement comparable to the next, so it is the layer kept importable without torch or vLLM: `engine_kwargs(args)` states what a fixture runner launches under, on a host that cannot run it. Entry and assembly take their side effects as arguments, so a test substitutes them; the side-effect layer is the substitution point, not the thing under test.

Order is part of the contract in two places. `VALIDATORS` runs the profile rules in a fixed sequence because the first raise is the sentence the operator reads. `SERVE_STEPS` writes into one argument list and later steps index into what earlier ones left.

| Location | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `glm53_setup/__main__.py` | Fixed command dispatch; no dynamic user-supplied module loading |
| `glm53_setup/config.py` | Checkout paths and validated pinned configuration |
| `glm53_setup/server.py`, `server_config.py`, `capacity.py`, `warmup.py`, `mojibake.py`, `agreement.py`, `chat_template.py`, `thinking.py` | Launch/client orchestration, categorized TOML settings, KV boot-line decomposition, the post-readiness request ladder, Japanese/Korean text checks, per-token agreement with a reference run (`server agreement`), and request-scoped thinking control |
| `glm53_setup/host.py` | Host-side helpers shared by the launcher: site validation, serve arguments, fabric checks, snapshot resolution, subprocess execution |
| `glm53_setup/download.py`, `verify_download.py`, `images.py`, `build_reference.py` | Asset preparation (pinned download, checksum verification that waits for the downloader, base-image inspection, reference-image build) and guarded local operations |
| `glm53_setup/cluster.py`, `switch.py`, `launch_assets.py`, `fabric.py` | Two-rank pre-stop checks, owned switch/recovery transaction, read-only launch identities and RoCE rail checks ([launch contracts](launch-safety.md)) |
| `glm53_setup/model_http.py`, `io.py` | Model-API-scoped HTTP transport that never follows redirects; durable local state helpers |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/pinned_patch.py`, `patch_*.py` | The source-pinned vLLM patches the image build applies: `pinned_patch` holds what they share (the hash gate on the pinned file, the `--package`/`--check` command, the record written beside the package); each `patch_*` module states its target, its pin and its anchors as a pure `patch_text(text)` that refuses a drifted or already patched source |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/weight_overlay.py` | Optional manifest-verified BF16 tensor replacement in the pinned main and MTP weight iterators; off by default ([overlay guide](abliteration.md)) |

The CLI imports GPU dependencies only when the selected command actually needs them. Help, configuration and CPU tests work without Torch or vLLM installed on the host. GPU programs execute inside the pinned image.

The commented `examples/server.example.toml` doubles as the complete server profile schema. Full TOML validation happens at `server_config.load` and the independently callable `server.command` boundary. `serve_args` consumes an already validated profile and does not reread the schema; it is an internal assembly step, not an input-validation entry point. Small fabric-specific guards remain independent.

Model ID and revision have one configuration source: [runtime.lock.json](../config/runtime.lock.json). Mutable files stay rooted at the checkout, independently of the caller's working directory. Run the toolkit from a maintained checkout; it is not offered as a general Python library.

Every build-time patch of the reference image checks the full SHA-256 of the pinned vLLM file it modifies before changing it, and the overlays for the published option are checked the same way at launch. The image keeps all selected attention candidates. The runtime math and the validation harness are separate modules so moving CLI code does not change the mathematical implementation.

## Validation boundaries

Download completion, checksum success, GPU smoke, config interpretation, attention parity, fixture integration and full-model TP=2 qualification are different evidence types. A result from one level cannot substitute for another. In particular, the one-GPU fixture cannot stand in for two-rank evidence.
